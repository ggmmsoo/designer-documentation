= Limitations

Vaadin Designer 1.0 has limitations that we hope to address as soon as possible.

* Multi-select
* Designs can not be nested
* Custom components and add-ons are rendered as place-holders
* Custom widget-sets are not used
* Data components, such as Table and Grid, all get the same dummy content
* You can not dynamically enter real or mock data
* Advanced components, which can not be properly configured with simple properties, are lacking features
* Component-specific edit mode is missing
* GridLayout column and rowspan can not be adjusted
* There is no fluid/relative grid for responsive design
* No easy way to swap a layout, keeping content (can be done in code)
