== Installing Eclipse and Plug-Ins

You need to install the following to use Vaadin Designer:

. Eclipse Luna SR2+ as described in
<<dummy/../../framework/installing/installing-eclipse#installing.eclipse,"Installing Eclipse IDE">>

. Vaadin Plug-in for Eclipse as described in
<<dummy/../../framework/installing/installing-eclipse#installing.eclipse.plugin,"Installing Vaadin Plugin for Eclipse">>

. Vaadin Designer from link:http://vaadin.com/eclipse[vaadin.com/eclipse]

Vaadin Designer is compatible with Eclipse Luna (and later) available from
link:http://www.eclipse.org/downloads[www.eclipse.org/downloads]. We recommend
choosing __Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers__.

If you're using an existing install of Eclipse Luna, please make sure it is
up-to-date. Eclipse Luna versions prior to the SR2 version had a nasty bug that
will cause problems for several plug-ins.

Vaadin Designer is installed together with the Vaadin Plug-in for Eclipse, from
the same Eclipse update-site. In Eclipse, do "Help > Install New Software",
press [guibutton]#Add...# next to the [guilabel]#Work with select#, enter
[literal]#++Vaadin++# as name and [uri]#http://vaadin.com/eclipse# as location.

If you already have the Vaadin plug-in installed, just choose to Work with the
Vaadin update site. Make sure the whole Vaadin category is selected (or at least
Vaadin Designer), then click [guibutton]#Next# to review licensing information
and finalize the install. Please restart Eclipse when prompted.

Once installed, Vaadin Designer can be kept up-to-date by periodically running
"Help > Check for Updates".

[[designer.installing.uninstalling]]
== Uninstalling

If you want to remove Vaadin Designer from your Eclipse installation, go to
"Help > Installation Details", select [guilabel]#Vaadin Designer# from the list,
then click [guibutton]#Uninstall#.
