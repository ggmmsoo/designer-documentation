= Licensing

The first time you start Vaadin Designer, it will ask for a license key. You
can obtain a free trial-license, purchase a stand-alone perpetual license, or
use the license included with your Pro Tools subscription. For instructions on
how to install the license, see
<<dummy/../../framework/addons/addons-cval#addons.cval,"Installing Commercial
Vaadin Add-on License">>.

Please note that a separate license key is required for each developer. If you
choose not to enter a license, you will be unable to save your design.

If you for any reason need to remove or change a valid license, it is located in
[filename]#~/.vaadin.designer.developer.license# in UNIX systems and
[filename]#C:\Users++\++[replaceable]##<username>##\.vaadin.designer.developer.license# in 
Windows.
